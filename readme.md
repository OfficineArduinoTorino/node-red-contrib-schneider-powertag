## Node-RED easy configurator to read Schneider PowerTags over Modbus TCP

This module is a painless-to-use UI to read data from a Schneider PowerTag energy monitoring environment.
This module is NOT a Modbus TCP client, it is meant to be used with **node-red-contrib-modbus** modules.

This module has been developed and tested on:
+ A9XMWA20 Schneider SmartLink Gateway
+ A9MEM1542 Schneider PowerTag
+ A9MEM1520 Schneider PowerTag
+ A9MEM1560 Schneider PowerTag Flex

This project is still a work in progress.
Inspired by the work of [hotswapster](https://github.com/hotswapster/powerTag).
